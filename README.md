### README ###

This project is for me to work more with Unity to develop a game which, as the title suggests, is a simple shooter. Currently, the game is not runnable outside of a Unity game scene, therefore to test it out I would recommend having Unity installed and opening the project to run the scene.

#### TODO ####
- [ ] Create UI 
  - Scoring system
  - Crosshair
  - Rules & How-to-play
- [x] Make Person entities turn and move in a random direction
  - Also maybe fixes the collision issues right now
- [x] Create Blender meshes of the Person entities & create materials for each version in Blender
- [ ] Bullets are destroyed ~0.5s after hitting a Person (allow for collats)
- [x] Cap on amount of Person entities allowed in Scene at one time
- [x] Make person rotation smoother
- [ ] [**IN PROGRESS**] Update the Spawner script by creating new prefabs for the Persons so the Spawner spawns those instead of the old ones
- [ ] Make distance travelled by persons random so not all moving + rotating at the same time

#### Possible Improvements ####
These improvements are under consideration / not a top priority
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Ensure that Person entities don't collide at all
- [ ] Visual update on Person models
